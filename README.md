# battle_tested_skills

Open-source [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skills for the
**CFA / quant community** — battle-tested helpers for investment research,
strategy stress-testing, and disciplined agentic engineering. Each skill is
self-contained: clone it, drop it into your Claude Code `skills/` directory,
and go.

## Skills

| Skill | What it does | Audience |
|---|---|---|
| [`roast-me`](roast-me/) | Coach-mode Socratic challenger that stress-tests an investment thesis, signal logic, backtest, or config. Runs a required quant-guardrail checklist (lookahead, survivorship, leakage, costs, overfitting) and ends with a written red-flag summary plus prioritized next moves. | CFA charterholders, quants, engineers |
| [`scaffold`](scaffold/) | Agentic project template — a `CLAUDE.md` senior-engineer persona plus a `docs/` context structure (memory, lessons, todo, session-log, PRD, references) for plan-first, self-improving, verification-driven workflows. | Anyone building with Claude Code |

## Install

Clone the repo, then run the installer. It copies every skill folder (any
folder with a `SKILL.md`) into your Claude Code skills directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alanvaa06/battle_tested_skills.git
cd battle_tested_skills
```

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
./install.sh                 # → ~/.claude/skills (personal, all projects)
./install.sh .claude/skills  # → into the current project's skills dir
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
./install.ps1                 # → ~\.claude\skills (personal, all projects)
./install.ps1 .claude\skills  # → into the current project's skills dir
```

Restart Claude Code (or start a new session) so it picks up the new skill.
Claude discovers it from `SKILL.md` and triggers it from the `description` —
e.g. say *"roast my thesis"* to fire `roast-me`.

### Manual install (one skill)

```bash
cp -r roast-me ~/.claude/skills/roast-me      # personal
cp -r roast-me .claude/skills/roast-me        # per-project
```

### scaffold (project template)

`scaffold` is a starter template, not an auto-discovered skill — it has no
`SKILL.md`. Copy its `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/` into a new project root:

```bash
cp -r scaffold/. /path/to/your/project/
```

The installers skip `scaffold` for this reason.

## Skill anatomy

```
<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md          # name + description frontmatter, then instructions
└── references/       # optional deeper material loaded on demand
```

## Contributing

This is a community container — PRs adding or improving skills are welcome.
Keep each skill self-contained, give it a clear trigger `description`, and add
a row to the Skills table above.
