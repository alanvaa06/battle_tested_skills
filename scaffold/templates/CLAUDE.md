# {{PROJECT_NAME}} — Claude Code instructions

## System Persona

{{SYSTEM_PERSONA}}

## Context files — read ON DEMAND, never bulk-read

`docs/context/` is the project's working memory: `memory.md` (architecture decisions), `lessons.md` (past mistakes → rules), `todo.md` (open work), `results.md` (build log), `sesion-log.md` (session history). These are reference, **not a boot sequence**. Bulk-reading all of them every task wastes thousands of tokens — DON'T.

- **Trivial / single-file task**: skip the context files entirely.
- **Non-trivial task**: `grep` the relevant file(s) for keywords tied to what you're touching (module, agent, symbol, feature) and read only the matching lines. Full-read a file only when its whole content is genuinely on-topic.
- **Before a fix**: grep `lessons.md` for the area — you may have hit it before.
- **When starting work**: check `todo.md` for the matching item and update its status (`pending` → `in_progress` → `done`).

## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan mode
- Use plan mode when a task involves an architectural decision, or when the user should approve the approach before files change. When you have enough information to act, act: don't re-derive settled facts or narrate options you won't pursue.
- If the approach stops working, stop and re-plan instead of pushing on.

### 2. Subagents
- Delegate independent subtasks to subagents and keep working while they run. Intervene if a subagent goes off track or is missing context.
- **Subagents don't inherit the conversation.** When dispatching one, paste the relevant lines from `memory.md`/`lessons.md` into its prompt — it can't know decisions it never saw.
- A `SubagentStop` hook auto-appends each subagent's final line to `results.md`; distill anything load-bearing into `memory.md` yourself.

### 3. Lessons
- After a correction from the user, record the pattern in `docs/context/lessons.md` (format under Task Management). Don't save what the repo or git history already records; update an existing line rather than adding a near-duplicate; delete a lesson that turns out to be wrong.

### 4. Verification before done
- Prove a task works before reporting it done: run the tests, check the logs, diff behavior against main when relevant.
- Before reporting progress, audit each claim against a tool result from this session. Report only work you can point to evidence for; if something isn't verified, say so. If tests fail, say so with the output; if a step was skipped, say that.

### 5. Scope
- When the user is describing a problem, asking a question, or thinking out loud rather than requesting a change, the deliverable is your assessment: report findings and stop. Don't apply a fix until asked.
- When given a bug report with a clear ask, fix it: point at logs, errors, failing tests, then resolve them. Stop only for destructive actions or genuine scope changes the user must decide.
- Before running a command that changes system state (restarts, deletes, config edits), check that the evidence supports that specific action.

## Task Management

1. **Write Plan**: Write plan phases to `docs/context/todo.md`. Todo format, one line per item.
2. **Document Results**: Add a review line to `docs/context/results.md` — keep readable, 1 to 4 lines. List format.
3. **Capture Lessons**: Update `docs/context/lessons.md` after a correction. List format. Friction only — if everything is a lesson, nothing is.
4. **Update memory**: When finishing a task or settling an architecture decision of high relevance, write to `docs/context/memory.md`: `# decision: sentence`. One line, readable. List format.
5. **Session-log**: After completing a major task or wrapping up a work block, append to `docs/context/sesion-log.md`: `[date]: information`. One line. (A `SessionEnd` hook writes a bare date stub automatically when you didn't — your line carries the substance, don't rely on the stub.)
6. **Context files have HARD CAPS — enforced by hook + `/compact-context`.** Cap values live in ONE place: `.claude/hooks/context-size-check.ps1` — never restate them here or elsewhere. That `UserPromptSubmit` hook stats the files every turn; **when you see `[context-size] OVER CAP`, run `/compact-context`** — it snapshots the file to `docs/context/archive/<file>/<date>.md`, then hard-compacts the active file in place. Day-to-day: one line per entry, no prose, dedupe before appending (never restate an existing fact); `todo.md` holds ONLY `pending`/`in_progress` (done → `results.md` → archive). Don't compact inline during feature work — that's what the command is for.

## References & Skills

- Coding and design standards live in global skills, not in this file. Follow them when they trigger.
- `docs/references/` holds **project-specific** reference material only (domain specs, API notes). Read on demand when the task touches that domain.
- Product requirement docs live in `docs/prd/` as `NNN-feature-name.md`.

## Core Principles

- Don't add features, refactor, or introduce abstractions beyond what the task requires. A bug fix doesn't need surrounding cleanup; a one-shot operation usually doesn't need a helper. Do the simplest thing that works well.
- Find root causes. No temporary fixes that mask a symptom.
- Validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs); trust internal code and framework guarantees. Don't add error handling for scenarios that cannot happen.
- A pre-existing bug or cleanup the task doesn't cover is a follow-up to report in your summary, not a change to make in this one.
